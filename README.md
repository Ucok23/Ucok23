### Hi there, I'm Ucok! üëã

I'm a seasoned **Full-Stack Developer** with a passion for building robust, scalable applications from concept to deployment. My expertise lies at the intersection of modern web technologies and artificial intelligence, allowing me to develop cutting-edge, full-stack AI products.

-   üöÄ I specialize in the **TypeScript/JavaScript** ecosystem, particularly with **React, Next.js, Node.js,** and **NestJS**.
-   üß† I have a strong background in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**, enabling me to architect and build intelligent applications.
-   üíª I'm a polyglot programmer, comfortable diving into Python for data-intensive tasks or lower-level languages like C when performance is critical.
-   üå± I'm currently expanding my skills in **Android Development** with **Kotlin**.
-   ‚ö° Fun fact: My love-hate relationship with JavaScript fuels my passion for taming it to build amazing things.
